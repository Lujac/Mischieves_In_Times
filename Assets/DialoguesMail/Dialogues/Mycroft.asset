  - "You there! Stop!\t"
  - "What are you doing here?\t"
  - "I\u2026 uh\u2026 fell down here.\t"
  - You "fell down"? In front of her Majesty's palace?
  - Well... yes?
  - ...
  - "What is this behind you?\t"
  - "This is... how I fell down.\t"
  - Is it to hurt her Majesty? I won't hesitate to have you jailed !
  - "I don\u2019t want to hurt the Queen, sir.\t"
  - "Then what are you doing here?\t"
  - "I don\u2019t know. I want to go home.\t"
  - "And how would you get home?\t"
  - "I need a clock.\t"
  - "Just like the one you have.\t"
  - My pocket watch ? It is not a vulgar clock! Why would it help you?
  - It's from the machine. I need it. Otherwise, I will stay here.
  - ...
  - "You shall have it, but on one condition. Go find my brother and ask him to give
    me back my golden pipe, it\u2019s an inheritance that I\u2019m very attached
    to."
  - You will find him at 221B Baker Street. Come back here afterwards, I will get
    you home.
  - Sir, how can you trust that person? We know nothing about them!
  - "If I have gardening questions I\u2019ll ask your opinion, now pipe down!"
  - Where? Is there a pipe on the ground?
  - "What are you talking about? There is no pipe on the ground, the pipe I want
    is at my brother\u2019s flat."
  - "But you just said \u201CPipe down\u201D, if there is no pipe on the ground,
    then what does it mean?"
  - "Oh, I see your confusion! \u201CPipe down\u201D doesn\u2019t mean that there
    is a pipe on the ground, it is a turn of phrase, I asked him to be quiet."
  - Now, I understand why I got -2 in English...
  - "Well then, I\u2019ll try to keep it simple now. Can\u2026 you go\u2026 and get\u2026
    the pipe\u2026 from\u2026 my brother\u2026?"
  - "It was a historical test in English, I understand you when you speak\u2026 "
  - Then it should be a lead-pipe cinch task for you.
  - Another pipe? When I say I understand, I mean that I understand easy words. What
    does that one mean, please?
  - Sorry, sorry. It means that it should be easy for you, a piece of cake if you
    prefer.
  - 'I know that one! '
  - "Great! Then, good luck my friend. My brother can be quite\u2026 Anyway, you\u2019ll
    see. Goodbye."
