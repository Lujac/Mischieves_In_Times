  - 'What is that machine you just used? '
  - "It\u2019s a technological thing, you\u2019ll understand later. That is the one
    I want! I need the pipe that you use to smoke tobacco, the golden one."
  - Oh my family inheritance?
  - "Yes, that\u2019s what Mycroft said, your family inherit-something."
  - "Well, you\u2019re out of luck. I\u2019ve just got robbed, and the only thing
    they took, was the golden pipe."
  - Oh no! I need it to go back home!
  - ' I was about to investigate and find the filthy thief who did this. Would you
    like to be my assistant on this investigation? Your flat technological thingy
    could help.'
  - "To solve a case with Sherlock Holmes? What an honour! Maybe, I\u2019ll be the
    one who solves the investigation."
  - "Well, if you find the culprit first, I\u2019ll eat my hat!"
  - Why would you eat such a nice hat?
